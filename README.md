# UI Navigation
UI Navigation, or known as hguinav, is a Hugo theme designed for accessibility rather than visual and made as easy as possible. Since I am a blind developer, I'd like to develop with accessibility as possible so visually impaired users can use them.

This theme is also available for Zola at [Zluinav](https://github.com/harrymkt/zluinav).

This theme uses blocks as possible because as far as I know Hugo does not allow extend and super functions like other static site generators.
