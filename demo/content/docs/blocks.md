# Blocks
Sometimes partial files are not enough. Or will they be cluttered. Blocks come in. You can define blocks to display content in position the block is defined in the base template. Here are available blocks that you can use:
- `title`: The title block. This should be completely optional anyway.
- `beforeheader`: Content before header, or another word, content immediately following the body tag.
- `extraheader`: Content after the header defined in header.html (partial).
- `nav`: Navigation / menu block.
- `main`: The main content.
